splunk-forwarder-raspberry-pi
=============================

This forwarder is lightweight, secure and can be installed on Raspberry Pi to provide real-time data collection from just about any local source. Use the Universal Forwarder to monitor local files, grab performance metrics from local resources such as the CPU and memory, or watch the file system for configuration, permissions and attribute changes. Finally, you can use Splunkâ€™s scripted input mechanism to monitor any sensor or peripheral device attached to your Pi and transmit its values over the network to Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud or Splunk Storm.

For basic documentation on installing and configuring Splunk Forwarders, please check out our universal forwarder documentation. For those completely new to Splunk, please check out our full documentation, and feel free to download a free copy of Splunk for your laptop or laboratory!
